Hello!

I'm a modest girl and do not know what to write, but for the sake of happiness, i need to overcome my fears. 

My name is Lola, i am 30 years old now. 
We live in the modern world and many people love to look for a soul mate over the Internet.
I consider myself as a determined, honest, cheerful.

Most importantly is the fact that my heart is open for love!
In the next letter I will be able to tell you more about me and of course will send my photos.

If you are interested, please write to my personal e-mail - beautekitty88@gmail.com

Lola.
